 * The HyperTree class implements an hyperbolic tree representation for data.

 * An HyperTree is build from hierarchical data, given as a tree
 * of HTNode. So, the first parameter to give to build an HyperTree
 * is the HTNode which is the root of the to-be-represented tree.
 * The tree to be displayed by the HyperTree should be build before the call
 * to HyperTree, that is the root node should return children
 * when the children() method is called.
 * <P>
 * You can get a HTView (herited from JView) containing the HyperTree by calling
 * getView().
